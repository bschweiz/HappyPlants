# Happy Plants

## You Gotta Keep â€˜Em Hyd-er-rated 

I want to build a plant-watering app to aid budding green-thumbs such as yours-truly in managing their plethoras of personal perennials. Happy Plants will allow users to check in on their plants organized via Plant Cards which will display the last date watered, and if there are any waterings upcoming. Users will be able to sort and display their plants by room, desired sun, or by most/least recently watered.

My own personal desire to create such an app grew out of an incident recently where my favorite succulent Fred almost died because I over-watered him after owning him and taking generally great care of him for 8 years. I used to have a visual board which featured a drawing of each of my succulents/plants and how much light they needed and if they had special watering needs, but my collection of plants has grown so much now that I truly lose track of whom (ie which plant) I have watered when.

I want to use the App as an opportunity to create a project whose styling I find truly impeccable. All my previous projects have looked OK, but I would love to make an app that I think actually looks nice rather than just acceptable. I want to make a rich-looking app with images from user uploads and an API. I want to build something that looks and feels smooth and professional to use. I believe that React will be the key to neatly handling/sharing/rendering the various data tables for these plant objects.
